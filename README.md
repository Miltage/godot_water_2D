# Godot Water 2D

Basic implementation of 2D water using springs to simulate waves

Based on [this old article](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/make-a-splash-with-dynamic-2d-water-effects--gamedev-236) that I had saved in my bookmarks from some 10 years ago

Contains project files for both Godot 3 and the new Godot 4.
